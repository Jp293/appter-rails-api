## Objective

*My objective was to develop a full-stack web application that creates lodging listings to help users find accomodations. The app is intended to accept a users' location, dates (check-in/out), and price-per-night as parameters for its searches. Appter also enables a dual interface between renters (individuals renting-out their apartments) and guests.

## Future Versions

I planned four more versions of the app to enable users to filter data with more efficiency.
* Attach images/photos to each listing for better advertisement.
* Filter data by price per night, location, availability in dates.
* Render a map to help users locate the listings by location.
* Create a communication feature to enable users chat amongst themselves to discuss listing details.
